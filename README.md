# Kodi-RPC
A Kodi Addon to show other your Kodi activity. Developed By CodeSharp

To use this addon, you need to follow these steps:

WARNING: To use this addon, you must be on the same connection between the Kodi Client and the Discord bridge server.


1) Download Python and open a terminal on Windows or Linux, then run this command: > pip install pypresence
Next, also run this command: > pip install flask3

2) Copy the file discord_bridge.py to a conveniently accessible directory.

3) Run discord_bridge.py on your computer with Discord open.

4) Extract the files from the kodi.service.discordrpc zip and copy the contents into the Kodi addons directory (I don't know why, but installing the zip using the method proposed by Kodi gives an error about the file structure).

5) Enable the addon through Kodi's settings, and if you have correctly followed these steps, you should see requests coming in every 2 seconds in the discord_bridge.py terminal. This is normal, don’t worry. It means the addon is working correctly.

Enjoy watching and have fun with Kodi RPC developed by CodeSharp/MasterSharp
